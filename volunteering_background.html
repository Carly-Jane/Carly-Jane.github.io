                In my role as a Committee Member, I worked with the wider community to facilitate events such as the "From the Heart" campaign discussions and submissions to parliament, Welcome to Country Training to groups within the organisation, Closing the Gap discussions and National Reconsiliation Week Discussions. <br>
                I was fortunate enough to have the oportunity to lead the 2021 Heal Country NAIDOC Week sub Committee. We delivered a number of sucessfull events, including multiple music performances, a Key Note Presentation in colaboration with Badgebup Aboriginal Corporation, a colaborative art work piece with staff and students from the the Dandjoo Darbalung Program and the facilitation of a number of volunteering opportunities to assist others in their NAIDOC celebrations, in collaboration with Volunteering WA.</p>

              <p class="card-text">I joined the Woodside Genger Equality Matters Community as a member in January 2019 to assist with the International Womens Day planning sub committee.<br>
                In both 2019 and 2020, I assisted the Perth based IWD sub committee to plan events that would include the remote assets in the celebrations, through communications, links to join Perth based events and morning tea speaker events to facilitate further discussion.<br>
                Prior to the 2019 IWD Morning Tea at the Karratha Gas Plant, the largest community event attendance at any Karratha Gas Plan event was less than just 40 attendees. In 2019, the attendance for the Karratha Gas Plant International Womens Day Morning tea was upwards of 120 people, which increased again at the 2020 International Womens Day Morning Tea, to upwards of 130 atendees.<br>
                These quality discussions lead by passionate speakers and leaders within the business, ensured the conversation of gender equality continued well and truely past International Womens Day.</p>

              <p class="card-text">I joined the Karratha Volunteer Fire and Rescue Service in February 2013 and served as a member until June 2019.<br>
              Over this time I was deployed state wide for bushfire emergencies including Waroona, Lake Clifton, Baldivis, Tom Price and Port Headland, and state wide for training at both Exmouth Fire & Rescue, Wickham Fire and Rescue and the Forestfield DFES Training Academy.<br>
            In addition to weekly vehicle checks, weekly training, weekend training, emergency callouts and community support activities, I created and implememnted the Hydrant Servicing Plan and Training Package.<br>
            At the 2015 KVFRS Annual Dinner, I was awareded but the 2015 KVFRS Firefighter of The Year Award, and the 2015 KVRFS Captains Award.<br>
            The technical skills and life skills that I leart during this time have formed a large part of who I am today. My time at KVFRS has taught me discipline, focus, inner strength and the importance of serving the community.<br></p>
